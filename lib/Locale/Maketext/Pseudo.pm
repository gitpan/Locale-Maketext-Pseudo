=head1 NAME

Locale::Maketext::Pseudo - give localized code a pseudo language obj if a real one does not exist.


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Locale::Maketext::Pseudo version 0.0.2


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Locale::Maketext::Pseudo;

    # localized Class::Std based object

    my %lang;
    
    sub BUILD {
        my ($self, $ident, $arg_ref) = @_;
        $lang{ $ident } = ref $arg_ref->{'lang_obj'} && $arg_ref->{'lang_obj'}->can('maketext') 
            ? $arg_ref->{'lang_obj'} : Locale::Maketext::Pseudo->new();
            ...
    }

Or in your main app so you can get on with writing it and have $lang available and functioning

   # TODO: setup Locale::Maketext::Utils based Lexicon and make $lang out of it but for now:
   my $lang = Locale::Maketext::Pseudo->new(); 


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Localized software is more useable by more people. You should localize your code. L<Locale::Maketext> has the easiest and best localization framework available IMHO, L<Local::Maketext::Utils> adds more useablility utility methods (for example, it adds say(), get(), print(), and fetch() to name just a few) and should be used in software of any size.

In a perfect world your main program would make a language object and pass it as part of an object constructor so that output the module might have is localized too.

What is your excellently localized module to do if no valid langauge object is passed? Or what can you do while you're setting up your Lexicon and what not?

You fallback to a Pseudo object so that the calls to maketext() (or say(), get(), print(), or fetch() if you'll be using a L<Locale::Maketext::Utils> obj) can be used and still get interpolated properly.


=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 FUNCTIONS

All are exportable, each takes the same args as the method of the same name (sans 'env_') 
and each uses $ENV{'maketext_obj'} if valid or it uses a L<Local::Maketext::Pseudo> object.

=over 4

=item env_maketext()

This will use $ENV{'maketext_obj'} if it can maketext, otherwise it uses the Pseudo method.

This is useful for languagifying, say, a module's carp()'ed errors without the module needing to know anythgin about the callers' langauge situation.

    local $ENV{'maketext_obj'} = MyLocale::Maketext::Utils->get_handle(@whatever) || '';
    use Locale::Maketext::Pseudo qw(env_maketext);
    
    my $obj = Fiddle->new({'lang_obj' => $ENV{'maketext_obj'} }); # now object uses same thing as function, see "OBJECT ORIENTED" below...  
    carp env_maketext('....', @whatever) if !$whatever;

=item env_fetch()

=item env_print()

=item env_get()

=item env_say()

=back


=head2 OBJECT ORIENTED

=over

=item new()

Take no arguments, just returns an object with access to the methods below.

The "Pseudo" idea is from the fact that the arguments are the same as the "pseudo"-ified method, 
the return value is the same as "pseudo"-ified method but no actual Lexicon magic is done. (IE it acts as a funtioning pseudo placeholder for a real language object.)


=item maketext()

Pseudo L<Locale::Maketext>'s maketext()

=item say()

Pseudo L<Locale::Maketext::Utils>'s say()

=item get()

Pseudo L<Locale::Maketext::Utils>'s get()

=item print()

Pseudo L<Locale::Maketext::Utils>'s print()

=item fetch()

Pseudo L<Locale::Maketext::Utils>'s fetch()

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Throws no warnings or exceptions of its own.


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Locale::Maketext::Pseudo requires no configuration files and the foloowing environment variables:

$ENV{'maketext_obj'} gets set to the language object on initialization ( for functions to use, see "FUNCTIONS" above ) unless the 'skip_env' key is tru in new()'s hashref argument.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

None.


=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
